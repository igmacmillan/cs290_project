					<h3 class="sectionTitle">Shaker</h3>
					<div class="text description">
						<p>Out of all the equipment listed I reccomend buying a shaker first. If you are not able to properly shake drinks that need them you are neither mixing them well enough or chilling them enough. Properly chilling a drink is just as important as mixing.</p>
						<p>You do not need to buy a full shaker; instead you can buy what are known as tins. As the name implies they are metal tins that can act as a lid by covering a pint glass, or a smaller tin, rather than having its own lid with a strainer. A built in stratiner is not that important if you have the next item on the list.</p>
					</div>
					<h3 class="sectionTitle">Strainer</h3>
					<div class="text description">
						<p>The name pretty much says it all. Once you have shaken your dink you may need to strain out ice or other items, potentially muddled ones, when you pour a drink</p>
						<p>Be sure to buy one that fits your shakers/tins and is not too flimsy. Othewise there is not much variety</p>
					</div>
					<h3 class="sectionTitle">Jigger</h3>
					<div class="text description">
						<p>If this is a new term for you it is worth committing to memory. A jigger allows you to easily and accurately measure alcohol for cocktails. The standard jigger has two sides, the larger measures out 1.5 ounces and the smaller .75 ounces. Many drink recipes will use the refer to "parts" when giving measurements. One part  refers to the larger side, and it follows logically that a half part refers to the smaller. </p>
						<p>Unless you have bar pourers on your bottles at home, which for the most part is impracticle, a jigger is the easiest way to measure for cocktails.</p>
					</div>
					<h3 class="sectionTitle">Muddler</h3>
					<div class="text description">
						<p>A muddler is used similar to a pestle to mash fruits and herbs at the bottom of the glass or shaker. One, more famous, drink that uses is a muddler is a mojito; used to mash, or muddle, the mint.</p>
						<p>If you don't plan to make a drink that requires a muddler this is not a must buy right off the bat.</p>
					</div>
					<h3 class="sectionTitle">Rocks Glass</h3>
					<div class="text description">
						<p>Also known as an Old Fashioned glass is a short glass. Rocks glasses are ideal for liqour served neat or on the rocks. They are also well sized for certain cocktails like an Old Fashioned or Manhatten.</p>
						<p>Besides being a short glass they have a wide brim and a thick bottom. The thick bottom allows you to muddle ingredients directly in the glass.</p>
					</div>
					<h3 class="sectionTitle">Highball Glass</h3>
					<div class="text description">
						<p>While a highball glass refers to something specific in this context I am using it to describe a larger glass for mixed drinks and cocktails. The exact type of highball glass you decide on really is a matter of personal style. Just remember to buy one large enough to make the effort of making a cocktail worth it. Noone likes their drink gone in two sips. </p>
						<p>For specific reccomendations you can buy an actual highball glass or use a pint glass, a jar or your standard table glasses.</p>
