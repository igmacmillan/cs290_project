				<h3 class="sectionTitle">Gin</h3>
				<div class="text description">
					<p>Gin is a spirit known for its juniper berry flavor. While other botanicals are added in addition to juniper berries, such as lemon and lavendor,
					your opinion on the juniper berry flavor more or less determines your love, or lack there of, for gin. Similar to how some unfortunate souls
					are genetically doomed to find that cilantro tastes like soap, there are those that find gin tastes like pinesol.</p>
					<p>For my money, there is no better wedding reception drink than a G&T.</p>
				</div>
				<h3 class="sectionTitle">Rum</h3>
				<div class="text description">
					<p>Rum is a generally sweet spirit given that it is distilled from sugar cane or molasses. If you have ever had a fantastically colorful drink with a 
					mini umbrella, odds are you've had rum. Rum can be spiced or flavored, as well as light or dark. One of the best features of rum is 
					that you don't have to choose between them, generally they mix and match well.</p>
					
					<p>If you lean to the sweeter side of cocktails, not that all rum cocktails have to be sweet, find your nearest tiki bar ASAP!</p>
				</div>
				<h3 class="sectionTitle">Tequila</h3>
					<div class="text description">
						<p>Tequilla is a spirit that originated in Mexico distilled from the agave plant. For some reason tequilla seems to be the most confusing spirit
						for people I know to buy. So let me give a few buying tips. If affordable, only buy tequilla made from 100% agave. There are three types of tequilla
						all great for different things.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Blanco: Aged less than 2 months. Great for mixed drinks like margaritas.</li>
							<li>Reposado: Aged from 2 months to 1 year. Have a more mellow flavor than blanco. Can be drank on its own or in a cocktail.</li>
							<li>Anejo: Aged for 1 to 3 years. A good anejo tequilla is excellent for sipping. You can certainly	use it for cocktails but it is worth giving it a try on its own with some ice.</li>
							<li>Gold is not a classic type of tequilla, and is not reccomended for anything including margaritas.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				<h3 class="sectionTitle">Vodka</h3>
					<div class="text description">
						<p> Vodka, which originated in Russia, is a spirit distilled from rye, wheat or potatoes. Historically, the idea of vodka has been to have no flavor at all, making it easy to enjoy.
						A traditional way to enjoy Vodka is chilled with a pickle chaser. A screwdrive, vodka and orange juice, is a standard first drink for many new to drinking.</p>
						<p>Nowadays there are plenty of flavored options as well; from fruit flavors to some that taste like "birthday cake". Enjoy the latter at your own risk.</p>
					</div>
				<h3 class="sectionTitle">Whiskey</h3>
				<div class="text description">
					<p>Whiskey, or whisky, is a spirit distilled from malted grain, generally barley or rye. If you have a friend that likes whiskey then you likely have also heard the
					"correct" way to enjoy it. Whether it is a splash of water, neat or with a single large ice cube to stop it from being watered down, among a few others, there are multitudes 
					of ways to enjoy different varieties of whiskey. Try a bunch and find out what you prefer. You will likely have different preferences based on the type of whiskey.</p>
					<p>Lastly, because it is more expensive does not make it better. There are $20 whiskies that are superior to $40 ones. Prices have gone a little high over the past few years due to 
					an increasing demand.</p>
