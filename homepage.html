				The purpose of this site is to pass along my enjoyment of spirits. This site is by no means meant to 
				illustrate the "correct" or "proper" way to enjoy a spirit. As a famous fake internet judge says: "People like 
				what they like".

				To further this sites purpose feedback is included right on the homepage. If you have suggestions related to design or content, or if you 
				just want to pass along well wishes please feel free to provide those here. I only ask that you keep the suggestions civil and that they would 
				be constructive suggestions you would want to hear in my place.
