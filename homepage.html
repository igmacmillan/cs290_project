				<p class="title">Mission</p>
				<p>
				The purpose of this site is to share my enjoyment of and limited, some would say extremley so, knowledge of spirits. This site is by no means meant to 
				convey the "correct" or "proper" way to enjoy a spirit. As a famous fake internet judge says: "People like 
				what they like". 
				</p>
				<p>
				To further this sites purpose feedback is included right on the homepage. If you have suggestions related to design or content, or if you 
				just want to pass along well wishes please feel free to provide those here. I only ask that you keep the suggestions civil and that they would 
				be constructive suggestions you would want to hear in my place.

						<p><strong>Sloe Gin</strong></p>
						<p>The clear weather of juniper
						darkened into winter.
						She fed gin to sloes
						and sealed the glass container.</p>
						<p>When I unscrewed it
						I smelled the disturbed
						tart stillness of a bush
						rising through the pantry.</p>
						<p>When I poured it
						it had a cutting edge
						and flamed
						like Betelgeuse.</p>
						<p>I drink to you
						in smoke-mirled, blue-
						black sloes, bitter
						and dependable.</p>
						<p><em>-Seamus Heaney</em></p>

					<div id="drinkingSong">
						<p><strong>A Drinking Song</strong></p>
						<p>Wine comes in at the mouth<br/>
						And love comes in at the eye;<br/>
						That’s all we shall know for truth<br/>
						Before we grow old and die.<br/>
						I lift the glass to my mouth,<br/>
						I look at you, and I sigh.</p>
						<p><em>-William Butler Yeats</em></p>

					<div id="beDrunk">
						<p><strong>Be Drunk</strong></p>
						<p>You have to be always drunk. That’s all there is to it—it’s the only way. 
						So as not to feel the horrible burden of time that breaks your back and bends you to the earth, you have to be continually drunk.</p>
						<p>But on what? Wine, poetry or virtue, as you wish. But be drunk.</p>
						<p>And if sometimes, on the steps of a palace or the green grass of a ditch, 
						in the mournful solitude of your room, you wake again, drunkenness already diminishing or gone, ask the wind, the wave, the star, the bird, the clock, everything that is flying, everything that is groaning, everything that is rolling, everything that is singing, everything that is speaking. . .ask what time it is and wind, wave, star, bird, clock will answer you: “It is time to be drunk! So as not to be the martyred slaves of time, be drunk, be continually drunk! On wine, on poetry or on virtue as you wish.”</p>
